  {
    slug: 'hyperfocal-table',
    beginner:
      'The hyperfocal distance is the closest point you can focus on while still keeping everything at infinity acceptably sharp. When you focus at the hyperfocal distance, your depth of field extends from half that distance all the way to infinity. Landscape photographers use this technique to maximize sharpness from foreground to horizon.',
    deeper:
      'Hyperfocal distance is derived from the thin-lens equation and the concept of the circle of confusion (CoC). It equals the focal length squared divided by the product of the f-number and the CoC diameter: H = f² / (N × c). Anything from H/2 to infinity falls within acceptable sharpness. The CoC depends on sensor size — smaller sensors have a smaller acceptable CoC, which pushes the hyperfocal distance farther away for the same focal length and aperture. This is why crop-sensor cameras appear to have greater depth of field: the CoC standard is tighter relative to the image area. In practice, diffraction softening at very small apertures (f/16 and beyond on most sensors) means there is a trade-off between maximizing depth of field and maintaining per-pixel sharpness.',

      'Camera sensors come in many different physical sizes, from the large medium-format chips used in studio cameras down to the tiny sensors in smartphones. A larger sensor captures more light, produces less noise, and makes it easier to blur backgrounds. Sensor size is one of the biggest factors separating camera categories.',
    deeper:
      'Sensor size affects photography in several interconnected ways. A larger sensor has a bigger area to collect photons, improving signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range. The "crop factor" describes how a sensor compares to the 35mm full-frame standard: an APS-C sensor with a 1.5x crop factor gives the same field of view with a 35mm lens as a full-frame camera would with a 52.5mm lens. This crop factor also multiplies the effective depth of field — a smaller sensor appears to give more depth of field at the same framing because you need a wider (shorter) lens to match the field of view. Pixel density (pixel pitch) is another key metric: packing more megapixels onto a smaller sensor shrinks each photosite, reducing per-pixel light gathering. A 24MP full-frame sensor has ~6µm pixels while a 24MP APS-C sensor has ~4µm pixels, which is why the full-frame sensor typically performs better at high ISO.',

      'A histogram is a graph that shows how bright or dark the pixels in your photo are. The left side represents shadows (dark areas), the middle represents midtones, and the right side represents highlights (bright areas). If the graph is bunched up on one side, your photo may be underexposed or overexposed.',
    deeper:
      'A histogram plots pixel count (vertical axis) against brightness level (horizontal axis, 0-255 for 8-bit images). In luminance mode, each pixel brightness is calculated as a weighted average of red, green, and blue channels (typically 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B, matching human perception). RGB mode shows three separate distributions, revealing which color channels may be clipping independently — a red channel pushed to 255 while blue is fine indicates highlight clipping in warm tones, such as a sunset sky. "Clipping" occurs when pixel values hit the 0 or 255 boundary, meaning shadow or highlight detail has been irrecoverably lost. Black clipping (pixels at 0) loses shadow detail; white clipping (pixels at 255) loses highlight detail. Shooting RAW gives roughly 2-3 extra stops of recoverable highlight headroom beyond what the JPEG histogram shows, which is why many photographers "expose to the right" (ETTR) — pushing exposure as bright as possible without clipping the RAW data.',

      'Color harmony theory is rooted in the color wheel, which arranges hues in a circle based on their wavelength relationships. Complementary colors sit opposite each other (e.g., blue and orange, red and green) and create maximum contrast. Analogous colors are neighbors on the wheel and produce smooth, cohesive palettes. Triadic harmony uses three evenly spaced hues for balanced vibrancy. Split-complementary modifies the complementary scheme by using the two neighbors of the opposite color, reducing tension while keeping contrast. Tetradic (double-complementary) uses four colors forming a rectangle on the wheel, offering the richest palette but requiring careful balance. In photography, these relationships appear naturally — golden hour produces analogous warm tones, while a red barn against green fields is complementary. The HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) model maps directly to the wheel: hue is the angle, saturation is the distance from center, and lightness controls the brightness.',
