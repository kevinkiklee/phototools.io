 *
 * Based on the Airy disk diameter matching the pixel pitch:
 *   d_airy ≈ 2.44 · λ · N      (diameter, first minimum)
 * Solving for N at d_airy = pixelPitch and λ = 550nm (green light):
 *   N ≈ pixelPitch / (2.44 × 0.00055 mm) ≈ pixelPitch / 0.001342 mm
 *                                        ≈ pixelPitch(µm) / 1.342
 * The 0.67 constant used below is the industry-standard simplification that
 * matches the Airy disk *radius* (not diameter) at the first minimum:
 *   N ≈ pixelPitch(µm) / 0.67
 * Stopping down beyond this f-number will reduce per-pixel sharpness due to
 * diffraction, even though overall depth of field increases.
