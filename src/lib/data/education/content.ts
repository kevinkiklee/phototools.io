      'Depth of field (DoF) is the range of distance in your photo that appears acceptably sharp. A shallow DoF blurs the background behind your subject, while a deep DoF keeps everything from foreground to horizon in focus. Controlling DoF is one of the most powerful creative tools in photography.',
    deeper:
      'Depth of field is governed by the circle of confusion (CoC) — the largest blur spot on the sensor that still looks sharp to the human eye. Three physical factors determine DoF: focal length, aperture, and subject distance. A wider aperture (lower f-number) produces a shallower DoF because the lens converges light at steeper angles, causing out-of-focus points to spread into larger circles on the sensor. Longer focal lengths magnify the image, which also magnifies the blur circles, narrowing the DoF. Moving closer to your subject reduces DoF for the same reason — the relative difference in distance between the subject and background becomes greater. The hyperfocal distance is the focus distance at which DoF extends from half that distance to infinity, maximizing sharpness across the entire scene.',

When the Airy disk becomes larger than the pixel pitch of the sensor, diffraction softening exceeds the sensor\'s ability to resolve detail, and you have reached the diffraction limit. Higher-resolution sensors with smaller pixels hit this limit at wider apertures. For example, a 50MP full-frame sensor with ~3.3 micrometer pixel pitch shows diffraction softening around f/8, while a 12MP sensor with ~7 micrometer pixels can be stopped down to f/16 without visible loss.
