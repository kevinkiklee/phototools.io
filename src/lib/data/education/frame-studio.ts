      text: 'Different aspect ratios serve different purposes. 1:1 (square) works well for social media and symmetrical compositions. 3:2 is the classic 35mm film ratio. 4:3 is common in micro four-thirds and older digital cameras. 16:9 is the standard widescreen ratio for video and cinematic compositions. 5:4 is traditional for 8×10 prints.',

      text: 'Adding a border around a photograph mimics the effect of a physical mat and frame. A white mat provides visual breathing room and directs focus inward. The width of the border relative to the image affects the perceived "weight" of the photograph. Gallery-style presentations typically use wider mats. A subtle shadow creates depth, simulating how a framed print sits on a wall.',
